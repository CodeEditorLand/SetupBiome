**Setup Biome** is a GitHub action that provides a cross-platform interface
for setting up the [Biome CLI](https://biomejs.dev) in GitHub
Actions runners.

## Inputs

The following inputs are supported.

```yaml
- name: Setup Biome
  uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2
  with:

    # The version of the Biome CLI to install.
    # This input is optional and by default the version will be automatically
    # detected from the project's dependencies. If no version is found in the
    # project's dependencies, the latest version of the Biome CLI will be installed.
    # Example values: "1.5.1", "latest"
    version: ""

    # The GitHub token to use to authenticate GitHub API requests.
    # This input is optional and defaults to the job's GitHub token.
    # Example value: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    token: ${{ github.token }}

    # The directory in which the lockfile will be looked for when automatically
    # determining the version of the Biome CLI to install. Defaults to the current
    # working directory.
    working-dir: ""
```

## Examples

### Automatic version detection

To automatically determine the version of Biome to install based on the project's dependencies, you can simply omit the `version` input.

The action will search for the version of the `@biomejs/biome` dependency in the lockfiles of popular package managers such as npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun. It will then install that specific version of the Biome CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <img src="https://bun.sh/logo.svg" width="16"> [Bun](https://bun.sh) users must configure Bun to output a yarn lockfile because this action cannot yet read bun's binary lockfile format.
> An easy way to do this is to add the following to your `bunfig.toml` file:
> ```toml
> [install.lockfile]
> print = "yarn"

If no version of the Biome CLI is found in the lockfiles, the action will install the latest version of the Biome CLI.

```yaml
- name: Setup Biome CLI
  uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2

- name: Run Biome
  run: biome ci .
```

### Latest version

Setup the latest version of the Biome CLI.

```yaml
- name: Setup Biome CLI
  uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2
  with:
    version: latest

- name: Run Biome
  run: biome ci .
```

### Specific version

Install version `1.5.1` of the Biome CLI.

```yaml
- name: Setup Biome CLI
  uses: biomejs/setup-biome@v2
  with:
    version: 1.5.1

- name: Run Biome
  run: biome ci .
```
